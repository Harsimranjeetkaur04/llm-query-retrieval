## Key Features

* **üß† LLM-Enhanced Retrieval**: Integrates **semantic query expansion**, **relevance re-ranking**, and **contextual embedding comparison** using LLMs to go beyond simple keyword matching.
* **üåê Distributed Search**: Leverages **Elasticsearch** with sharding and distributed indexing for highly scalable and resilient data storage and retrieval.
* **‚ö° Performance Optimized**: Implemented **query caching layers** (e.g., Redis) and **asynchronous query processing** to handle high traffic loads and minimize latency.
* **‚öôÔ∏è Powerful API**: A robust **RESTful API** serves as the backend, supporting complex query syntax, filtering, and aggregations.
* **‚ÜîÔ∏è Horizontally Scalable**: The entire system is designed for horizontal scalability, supporting elastic expansion with load balancing to meet growing demand.
* **üìö Comprehensive Documentation**: Includes detailed documentation covering system architecture, caching strategies, API specifications, and deployment guidelines.

## System Architecture

The system processes a user's query through a multi-stage pipeline to ensure the most relevant results are returned quickly.



1.  **API Gateway**: The user's request first hits the REST API, which serves as the entry point.
2.  **Query Processing & Caching**: The system checks a cache (like Redis) for existing results. If not found, the query proceeds.
3.  **LLM Query Expansion**: The raw query is sent to an LLM to generate synonyms, related terms, and a semantic vector representation.
4.  **Distributed Search**: The expanded query is used to search the distributed Elasticsearch cluster. This initial retrieval phase fetches a broad set of potentially relevant documents.
5.  **LLM Re-ranking**: The initial results are passed back to the LLM, which re-ranks them based on deeper contextual relevance to the original query.
6.  **Response**: The final, re-ranked results are returned to the user and cached for future requests.

## Requirements

This system depends on a combination of Python libraries and external services.

**Services:**
* **Elasticsearch** (v8.0+)
* **Redis** or another caching service
* Access to an **LLM API** (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) or a self-hosted model

**Python Libraries:**
* `fastapi` or `flask` (for the API)
* `elasticsearch-py`
* `redis-py`
* `gemini` or `langchain`
* `uvicorn` (for serving)
* `pydantic` (for data validation)(on-going)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally. This guide assumes you have Elasticsearch and Redis running and accessible.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/intelligent-query-retrieval.git](https://github.com/your-username/intelligent-query-retrieval.git)
    cd intelligent-query-retrieval
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file and populate it with your service credentials and configurations.
    ```ini
    # .env file
    ELASTICSEARCH_HOST=http://localhost:9200
    REDIS_HOST=localhost
    REDIS_PORT=6379
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

---

## Usage

Once the services are running and the application is configured, you can start the API server.

1.  **Start the API Server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```
    The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Send a Query:**
    Use `cURL` or an API client to send a complex query to the `/search` endpoint.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST [http://127.0.0.1:8000/search](http://127.0.0.1:8000/search) \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{
               "query": "What are the latest advancements in battery technology?",
               "filters": {
                 "publication_year": "2024",
                 "category": "materials_science"
               },
               "top_k": 5
             }'
    ```

3.  **Expected Response:**
    The API will return a JSON object with the ranked search results.
    ```json
    {
      "query": "What are the latest advancements in battery technology?",
      "results": [
        {
          "rank": 1,
          "score": 0.98,
          "title": "Solid-State Batteries: The Next Frontier",
          "document_id": "doc_123"
        },
        {
          "rank": 2,
          "score": 0.95,
          "title": "Improving Lithium-Ion Anodes with Silicon",
          "document_id": "doc_456"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## Roadmap

Future development is focused on making the system even more intelligent and insightful.

-   [ ] **Incorporate User Feedback**: Integrate user feedback loops (e.g., click-through rates, thumbs up/down) for continuous relevance tuning.
-   [ ] **Federated Search**: Add the ability to perform federated searches across multiple, disparate datasets and indexes.
-   [ ] **Monitoring & Analytics**: Build a dashboard (e.g., using Kibana or Grafana) for monitoring system health and providing insights into query performance.
-   [ ] **Hybrid Search**: Implement hybrid search techniques combining keyword-based (BM25) and vector search for more robust results.
